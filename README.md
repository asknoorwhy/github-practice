# Git & GitHub Practice

This repository is for practicing Git and GitHub commands.

## What I practiced

- Initializing a Git repository with `git init`.
- Tracking files with `git add`.
- Saving changes with `git commit`.
- Connecting to GitHub with `git remote add origin`.
- Uploading changes to GitHub with `git push`.

## Goal

I will use this workflow later to upload my data analysis projects (Excel, Power BI, SQL, Python) to GitHub.
